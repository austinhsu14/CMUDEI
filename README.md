Using a more modern approach to design, my team developed a look at what the current Carnegie Mellon University Diversity Equity and Inclusion Center's website could look like. Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript fundamentals, my team built a very modern and eye popping design that does not overcrowd users with information. This project is currently being considered as a new change for how the Center's website could look like.
